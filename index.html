          <p class="ssl">
            SSL is standard technology for securing an internet connection by encrypting data
            sent between a website and a browser (or between two servers). It prevents hackers 
            from seeing or stealing any information transferred, including personal or financial data.

          <h3 class="firsth3">Transport Layer Security(TLS):</h3>
          <p class="tls">
            TLS is the successor to SSL. It provides stronger encryption and security for data
             transmission. It's essentially an improved version of SSL.

          <h3 class="secondh3">How can I tell that my webpage is secure?</h3>
          <p class="webpage-secure" >
            You can tell if a webpage is secure if there is a padlock icon in the browser's 
            address bar and if the URL starts with https:// instead of http://.

          <h3 class="thirdh3">What does it mean to be secure?</h3>
          <p class="secure-meaning">
            A secure website ensures that any data transferred between the website and the user
             (such as login details or payment information) is encrypted, meaning it can't be read
              or tampered with by unauthorized third parties.

      <div class="container">
          <h3 class="fourthh3">What is encryption and why do I care? </h3>
          <p class="encryption">
            Encryption is the process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
             It's important because it protects sensitive information 
             (e.g., credit card details, personal information) when browsing the internet.

              <h3 class="fifthh3">Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure websites?</h3>
              <p class="prefixes-http">
                Yes,HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.When a website and server sent information over HTTP, 
                anyone between the website and server could copy the data being sent across. 
                thats mean hackers could easily access the personal information or financial details
                of anyone purchasing goods online.

          <p class="ssl-certificate">
            A certificate authority (CA) is a company that issues SSL certificates. 
             (such as websites, email addresses, companies, or individual persons) and bind them 
             to cryptographic keys through the issuance of electronic documents known as 
             digital certificates.These certificates verify the identity of a website and
              ensure its authenticity.
